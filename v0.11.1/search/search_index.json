Absolutely flat amplitude response throughout the passband with a 6 dB/octave rolloff rate after the crossover point.\n2. The acoustic sum of the two driver responses is unity at crossover. (Amplitude response of each is -3 dB at crossover, i.e., there is no peaking in the summed acoustic output.)\n3. Zero phase difference between drivers at crossover. (Lobing error equals zero, i.e., no tilt to the polar radiation pattern.) In addition, the phase difference of zero degrees through crossover places the lobe of the summed acoustic output on axis at all frequencies.\n4. The low pass and high pass outputs are everywhere in phase. (This guarantees symmetry of the polar response about the crossover point.)\n5. All drivers are always wired the same (in phase).\n</code></pre> <p>Note</p> <p>The LPF freq mod LFO is tapered to match the Moog MF-101S' filter freq parameter. </p>"},{"location":"attributions/#docs","title":"Docs","text":"<p>SousaFX's documentation is made with Material for MkDocs.</p> <p>The EULA is modified from Reaper's.</p>"},{"location":"attributions/#many-thanks-to","title":"Many thanks to","text":"<p>Brooklyn College's Sonic Arts program, and Performance and Interactive Media Arts Program</p> <p>The Jim and Jamie Self Creative Award</p> <p>Cycling 74`</p> <p>Eventide Audio</p> <p>Brian Wolff</p> <p>My friends and family</p> <p>Everyone in the Max discord channel</p> <p>YOU for reading this far :)</p>"},{"location":"bindings/","title":"Bindings","text":""},{"location":"bindings/#bindings","title":"Bindings","text":"<p>A list of all connections between the game controller and audio effect parameters.</p> <p>Note</p> <ul> <li> <p>Y, B, A, and X will be referred to as North, East, South, and West.</p> </li> <li> <p>The shoulder buttons, L1, R1, L2, and R2, will be referred to as Left Bumper, Right Bumper, Left Trigger, and Right Trigger</p> </li> <li> <p>Thumbstick1 will be referred to as Left Thumbstick.</p> </li> <li> <p>Thumbstick2 will be referred to as Right Thumbstick.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"bindings/#start-select-cardinal","title":"Start, Select, Cardinal","text":"<p>Start and Select are used for changing the function of the North, East, South, and West buttons.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Without start or select pressed:</p> Direction Function north tap tempo east drum looper start / stop / clear south main stutter enable west bassline looper start / stop / clear </li> <li> <p>With start pressed:</p> Direction Function north toggle kick-ducker east toggle kick-ducker south toggle kick-ducker west toggle kick-ducker </li> <li> <p>With select pressed:</p> Direction Function north toggle metronome east south toggle bumper drumming west </li> <li> <p>With start and select pressed:</p> Direction Function north set time signature numerator via number of clicks (3 - 7) east south increment drum kit preset number west </li> </ul>"},{"location":"bindings/#shoulder-buttons","title":"Shoulder Buttons","text":"<p>While the tuba isn't playing, and the drum looper isn't looping, pressing the shoulder buttons triggers drum samples, and holding the shoulder buttons retriggers drum samples at the rate set by the dpad.</p> button samples Left Trigger clap Left Bumper snare Right Trigger tom Right Bumper kick <p>While the tuba is playing, or the drum looper is looping, the shoulder buttons operate as follows:</p> <p>The left bumper, and the dpad, are used for setting the subdivision of the auto-wah, delays, and stutters.
