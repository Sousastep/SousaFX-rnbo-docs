Absolutely flat amplitude response throughout the passband with a 6 dB/octave rolloff rate after the crossover point.\n2. The acoustic sum of the two driver responses is unity at crossover. (Amplitude response of each is -3 dB at crossover, i.e., there is no peaking in the summed acoustic output.)\n3. Zero phase difference between drivers at crossover. (Lobing error equals zero, i.e., no tilt to the polar radiation pattern.) In addition, the phase difference of zero degrees through crossover places the lobe of the summed acoustic output on axis at all frequencies.\n4. The low pass and high pass outputs are everywhere in phase. (This guarantees symmetry of the polar response about the crossover point.)\n5. All drivers are always wired the same (in phase).\n</code></pre> <p>Note</p> <p>The LPF freq mod LFO is tapered to match the Moog MF-101S' filter freq parameter. </p>"},{"location":"attributions/#docs","title":"Docs","text":"<p>SousaFX's documentation is made with Material for MkDocs</p> <p>The EULA is modified from Reaper's</p> <p>Computer requirements from Cycling74.</p>"},{"location":"attributions/#many-thanks-to","title":"Many thanks to","text":"<p>Brooklyn College's Sonic Arts program, and Performance &amp; Interactive Media Arts Program</p> <p>The Jim and Jamie Self Creative Award</p> <p>Cycling 74`</p> <p>Eventide Audio</p> <p>Brian Wolff</p> <p>My friends and family</p> <p>Everyone in the Max discord channel</p> <p>YOU for reading this far :)</p>"},{"location":"bindings/","title":"Bindings","text":""},{"location":"bindings/#bindings","title":"Bindings","text":"<p>This page describes how the gamepad controls SousaFX.
