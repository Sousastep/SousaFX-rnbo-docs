# Loopers

While the looper is clear, [single tap](bindings.md/#start-select-cardinal) to begin recording. The bassline loop is currently hardcoded to 16 bars, and the drum loop, 8 bars. The looper will auto-end recording, and start playing.

While a looper is playing, single tap to begin stopping. the loop will stop and clear after the entire recording has played.

Double-tap to immediately clear the loop.

If pressed accidentally, hold for more than one second, and upon release nothing will happen.

While the bassline looper is looping, the tuba's effects auto-switch from "bassline" to "solo".

While the drum looper is looping, the shoulder buttons will not trigger the drum samples.

Whenever a looper starts recording or stopping, a sound alert plays in the monitor mix. The volume of this alert can be adjusted via the Alert Volume knob in the [main window](overview.md/#main-window).
