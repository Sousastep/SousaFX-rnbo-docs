# Loopers

While the looper is cleared, [single tap](bindings.md/#start-select-cardinal) to begin recording. The looper will auto-end recording after 8 or 16 bars has passed and the looper input is silent.

While a looper is playing, single tap to begin stopping. the loop will stop and clear after the entire recording has played.

Quickly double-tap to immediately stop recording or playing, and clear the loop.

If pressed accidentally, hold for more than one second, and upon release nothing will happen.

The bassline looper is currently hardcoded to 16 bars, and the drum looper, 8 bars.

While the bassline looper is looping, the tuba's effects switch from "bassline" to "solo".

While the drum looper is looping, the shoulder buttons will not trigger the drum samples.

Whenever a looper starts recording or stopping, a sound alert plays in the monitor mix. The volume of this alert can be adjusted via the Alert Volume knob in the [main window](overview.md/#main-window).
