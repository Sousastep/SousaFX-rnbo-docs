# Loopers

While the looper is clear, [single tap](bindings.md/#start-select-n-e-s-w) to begin recording. The looper will auto-end recording after the set amount of bars has passed.

To set the loop length in bars, hold start and select, and tap the respective looper button between 4 and 16 times.

While a looper is playing, single tap to begin stopping. the loop will stop and clear after the entire recording has played.

Double-tap at any time to immediately clear the loop.

If pressed accidentally, and not yet released, just hold for more than one second, and upon release nothing will happen.

While the bassline looper is looping, the tuba's effects auto-switch from "bassline" to "solo".

While the drum looper is looping, the shoulder buttons will not trigger the drum samples.

Whenever a looper starts recording or stopping, a sound alert plays in the monitor mix. The volume of this alert can be adjusted via the Alert Volume knob in the [mixbus window](overview.md/#mixbus). The alerts can be changed by replacing the files in `/SousaFX-rnbo/media/`.
