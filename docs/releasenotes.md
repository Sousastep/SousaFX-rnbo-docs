# Release Notes

## 0.11.2

- Now fully functional on the [Raspberry Pi 5](https://github.com/Sousastep/sousaFX-rpi-scripts).

- Declick stutter fx & DJ-filter.

- Fix erroneous looper state transitions.

- Compress drum's low freqs with bassline, instead of compressing bassline's low freqs with drums.

- As the joystick's magnitude increases, the amount that the tuba envelope affects the LPF's LFO's floor/ceiling decreases.

- The bassline delay is now sent into the main stutter so it can be perma-enabled while looping the next drumbeat.

- Replaced CPU-heavy filters with more efficient filters.

- Add binding to transpose pitchshifter up a 5th.
