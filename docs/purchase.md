# Purchase

SousaFX has a 30-day evaluation period, after which a closeable popup will appear when SousaFX is launched, directing you to purchase a license. Purchasing a SousaFX license supports further development and unlocks a [prestige system](prestige.md) that tracks how many hours youâ€™ve used SousaFX for.

A commercial license is $225 and a discounted license is $60.

You may use the discounted license if:

- You are an individual, and SousaFX is only for your personal use, or
	
- You are an individual or business using SousaFX commercially, and yearly gross revenue does not exceed USD $20,000, or
	
- You are an educational or non-profit organization.

Payment may be sent via any of the following platforms. Please be sure to include the email address that you would like the license key sent to.
