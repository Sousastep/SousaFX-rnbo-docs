# Hardware Requirements

1. Tuba

3. Audio interface:

	Any interface with one mic input, and separate monitor and headphone outputs, will do.


4. Headphones, in-ear monitors, or loudspeaker:
	
	!!! note
	
		To hear yourself while performing live, [in ear monitors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHoljbkyAEs) are vastly preferrable to headphones or speakers.


5. XLR microphone, or Yamaha SilentBrass:
	
	A clip-on mic such as the [Audio-Technica Pro35](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Audio-Technica+Pro35), velcroed in the bell with [fastener strips](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=fastener+strips), works well.
	
	The [SilentBrass mute](https://usa.yamaha.com/products/musical_instruments/winds/silent_brass/silent_brass_sbj_series/index.html) requires an [eighth inch TRS to dual quarter inch TS cable](https://www.sweetwater.com/store/search?s=3.5mm+trs+to+dual+1%2F4+ts) to connect the PersonalStudio’s headphone output to the audio interface’s line inputs.


6. Wireless game controller:
	
	Most controllers are supported (All are listed [here](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/src/joystick/SDL_gamepad_db.h)).
