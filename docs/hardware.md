# Hardware Requirements

1. Computer:

	Any m-series mac is recommended, but an equivalent windows PC can work, too. To optimize your computer for audio performance, [check out Ableton's articles](https://help.ableton.com/hc/en-us/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=optimize). SousaFX is tested on a minimum-specification m1 macbook pro.

2. Audio interface:

	Any interface with one mic input, and separate monitor and headphone outputs, will do. If you aspire to perform in DJ lineups, having an RCA output is useful, too.

3. Headphones, in-ear monitors, or loudspeaker:
	
	To hear yourself while performing live, [in ear monitors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHoljbkyAEs) are vastly preferrable to headphones or speakers.


4. XLR microphone:
	
	A clip-on mic such as the [Audio-Technica Pro35](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Audio-Technica+Pro35), velcroed in the bell with [fastener strips](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=fastener+strips), works well.

5. Wireless game controller:
	
	Most controllers are supported (All are listed [here](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/src/joystick/SDL_gamepad_db.h)). SousaFX is tested with an Xbox Elite 2 controller.

6. Tuba:

	Any will do.
