# Hardware Requirements

1. Computer:

	Any M-series Mac is recommended, and an equivalent Windows PC can work, too. SousaFX is tested on the cheapest M1 MacBook Pro.

2. Audio interface:

	Any interface with one mic input, and separate monitor and headphone outputs, will do.

3. Headphones, in-ear monitors, or loudspeakers:
	
	To hear yourself while performing live, [in ear monitors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHoljbkyAEs) are vastly preferrable to headphones or speakers.

4. XLR microphone:
	
	A clip-on mic such as the [Audio-Technica Pro35](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Audio-Technica+Pro35), velcroed in the bell with [fastener strips](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=fastener+strips), works well.

5. Wireless game controller:
	
	Most controllers are supported. For SousaFX's layout, Xbox controllers are slightly more ergonomic than PlayStation controllers. SousaFX is tested with an Xbox Elite 2 controller.

6. Tuba or didgeridoo:

	Any will do.
