# Setup

1. Pair the game controller with the computer via bluetooth or cable. 

	!!! note
	
		Check that the start/select buttons don’t trigger anything outside of SousaFX, such as Steam, or your operating system. For example, on MacOS 13 or later, follow these steps to disable "Share Gestures":

			- open System Settings
			- scroll down the sidebar and click Game Controllers
			- scroll down to Profiles and click + to add a new profile
			- scroll down to Share Gestures and set “Double Press” to “Off”
			- Click “Done”
			- Scroll up to your controller and select it
			- Set “Use Profile” to the new profile
			- Click “Done”

2. Attach the controller to the tuba using velcro, cable ties, or rubber bands.

3. Connect your computer, interface, mic, and monitors. 
	
	On the interface, ensure that direct monitoring is disabled. 

	While playing tuba as loudly as possible, adjust the mic's input gain so that the mic peaks safely below clipping (around -10 dB).
