# SousaFX Documentation

SousaFX is a multi-effects rig made with [Max/RNBO](https://cycling74.com/products/rnbo), which uses a game controller attached to the side of the tuba to control a number of audio effects, including:

- A dubstep-style [auto-wah](overview.md#bassline) with many facets tuned specifically for tuba.
- Two one-button [loopers](loopers.md), one for the bassline and one for the drum machine.
- Dub-style filter delays.
- Reversible stutters with acceleration via a phase-locked loop.
- DJ-style HP/LP filters.
