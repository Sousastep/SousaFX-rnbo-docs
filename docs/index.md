# Introduction

SousaFX is a multi-effects rig made with [Max/RNBO](https://cycling74.com/products/rnbo) with the goal of bringing [dubstep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7fakBm0H_Q) into the repertoire of genres that tuba & didgeridoo players can perform. A game controller attached to the side of the instrument is used to control a number of audio effects, including:

- Dub-style delays with separate parameters for feedback amount and input volume.
- Reversible stutters with acceleration via phase-locked loops.
- 64 drum samples, playable with the bumpers and triggers.
- Two one-button loopers, one for the bassline and one for the drums.
- DJ-style HP/LP filters.
- An auto-wah carefully tuned to be as musical as possible.
