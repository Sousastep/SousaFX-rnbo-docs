# SousaFX Documentation

SousaFX is a multi-effects rig made with [Max/RNBO](https://cycling74.com/products/rnbo), which uses a game controller attached to the side of the tuba to control a number of audio effects, including:

- A dubstep-style auto-wah with many facets tuned specifically for tuba basslines.
- Drums samples, playable with the bumpers and triggers.
- Two one-button loopers, one for the bassline and one for the drums.
- Dub-style filter delays with separate input volume, and feedback amount parameters.
- Reversible stutters with acceleration via phase-locked loops.
- DJ-style HP/LP filters.
